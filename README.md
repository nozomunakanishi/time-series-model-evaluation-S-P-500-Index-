Evaluation of Time Series Models for predictive accuracy with financial data. 

## Executive Summary
This project compares classical time-series models (SARIMA, SARIMAX) with modern deep learning models (LSTM, GRU, Bi-LSTM) on weekly S&P 500 data (2004–2023).  
The results showed:
- SARIMAX outperformed plain SARIMA by ~16% (lower RMSE).  
- Plain deep learning models performed similarly to SARIMA.  
- A hybrid SARIMAX–LSTM achieved the **lowest test error (RMSE ≈ 0.0177)**.  

Alongside the analysis, a **Tableau dashboard** was built for interactive model comparison.  
This project demonstrates skills in time-series modelling, deep learning, hyperparameter tuning, reproducibility, and storytelling.
